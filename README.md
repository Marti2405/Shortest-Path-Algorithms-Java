# Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra and A* Algorithms for Shortest Paths in Java — INSA Toulouse

This repository contains implementations of the Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and A* algorithms for finding shortest paths in Java. The project is part of INSA Toulouse coursework.

## Running the GUI

To run the project, execute the Java file:

`be-graphes-gui\src\main\java\org\insa\graphs\gui\MainWindow.java`

Once the GUI starts, you can open a map from the maps folder.

## Using Shortest-Path Algorithms

1. Click on "Algorithms" in the top left corner of the screen and select "Shortest-Path."

![Select algorithm](imgs/select_algorithm.png)

2. A module will appear on the right side of the screen. Choose the desired algorithm (Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, A*) from the top list.

![Select algorithm module](imgs/module.png)

3. After selecting the algorithm, you can place the initial and destination points on the map. Press the "Start" button in the module to begin the algorithm.

![Example](imgs/example.png)

Watch the progression of the algorithm in blue, and the shortest path will be shown in a different color. Path statistics will be displayed at the top of the module.

## Additional Maps

You can download more maps from [this link](https://data.typename.fr/insa).

## Open problem

You can see our response to an open problem about the optimal crossing paths between 2 routes here:
